      What is an azimuth?<br />
      <br />
      In navigation, an azimuth is the horizontal angle between a reference point, such as true north, and a point of interest. Obtaining an azimuth helps enable navigators to ascertain their current position, make course corrections, and determine where they are headed.<br />
